## Key Contributions

- **Research Focus:** Investigated bio-inspired polarized light navigation using polarization angle images in an underwater Snell window for solar meridian acquisition.

- **Algorithm Development:** Designed a solar meridian extraction method based on the principle of Hough Transform and implemented an algorithm in C++ to automatically extract the solar meridian from the image.

- **Experimental Validation:** Applied the algorithm to find the solar azimuth angle, and the accuracy was verified to be within 1.5 degrees through outdoor experiments.

- **Recognition:** Completed and defended the graduation thesis with distinction.
