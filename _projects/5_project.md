## Project Description

This project involved designing and implementing advanced control and planning algorithms for autonomous vehicle navigation in complex traffic scenarios.

**Keywords:** Optimal Control, LQR, A\* Search, Robotics, Path Planning

---

## Key Contributions

- **Control System Design:** Designed a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for high-speed trajectory tracking with robust control performance.

- **Path Planning Integration:** Integrated an A\* search algorithm for dynamic path re-planning to perform safe overtaking maneuvers in complex traffic scenarios.

- **Performance Achievement:** Achieved an average path tracking error of 0.76m, demonstrating precise control and navigation capabilities.

- **Real-time Systems:** Implemented real-time obstacle avoidance and replanning strategies for autonomous vehicle navigation.
