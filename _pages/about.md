Hi there! 你好呀! こんにちは!

I'm Kanlong Ye, a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering (Robotics Track) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), specializing in **Robotics and AI**. With a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, I am passionate about advancing intelligent robotic systems that can navigate and understand the physical world.

At CMU, my research lies at the intersection of machine learning and robotics. I work in the [Computational Engineering & Robotics Lab (CERLAB)](https://zhefanxu.com/uav_team/) under Professor [Kenji Shimada](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/shimada-kenji.html). I've built full UAV autonomy stacks from the ground up—both in simulation (Gazebo, Isaac Sim) and on physical platforms—integrating perception, planning, and control for robust autonomous navigation.

Previously, I received my B.Eng from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/) with hands-on experience in robotic systems, MEMS fabrication at [Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), and computer vision for underwater navigation.

## Looking Forward

I'm currently seeking **industry opportunities** in robotics and machine learning. Check out my [CV](assets/cv.pdf) and feel free to connect!
